# Engineering notes

A running log of decisions, surprises, and self-audits. The guiding habit:
**treat a too-good number as a bug** — when a metric looks great, stop and
investigate leakage before celebrating, and write down what was found.

## Phase 0 — scaffolding & tooling

- **Dependency strategy.** The core install is intentionally light (numpy,
  pandas, scikit-learn, pydantic, typer, matplotlib). The heavy ML stack
  (LightGBM, SHAP, MLflow, imbalanced-learn, Optuna, seaborn, and PyTorch) lives
  in optional extras (`train`, `ae`). Every module that uses them imports lazily
  and has a graceful fallback, so the package imports and the fast test path is
  green even without them.
  - *Designed-in fallbacks:* LightGBM → scikit-learn `HistGradientBoosting`;
    SHAP → permutation importance; MLflow → local JSON run log; autoencoder →
    Isolation Forest only.
- **Surprise (good one).** The local interpreter is Python 3.14, newer than the
  3.11 target. I expected some heavy wheels (especially PyTorch) to be missing,
  but a probe showed **the entire stack installs on 3.14**. So the local demo can
  use the real premium models, while CI still pins 3.11/3.12 for portability.
- **Config-first.** All knobs (seed, paths, split strategy, model
  hyperparameters, FPR targets) live in `configs/default.yaml` and the typed
  `Settings` model. No magic numbers are allowed in code.
- **Reproducibility primitive.** `seed_everything` seeds Python, NumPy, and (if
  present) Torch from one config seed; estimators get the same seed via
  `random_state`.

## Invariants I am holding myself to (from the project rules)

1. No identifier/timestamp column (`Flow ID`, IPs, ports, `Timestamp`) ever
   reaches a model. A test will enforce it.
2. Transformers are fit on the training split only; never compute a statistic
   over the full dataset.
3. The headline evaluation is the **temporal/by-day split**; the stratified
   number is reported only as an optimistic reference, with the gap called out.
4. Lead with PR-AUC, per-class P/R/F1, and TPR@fixed-FPR — never accuracy.
5. Every run is reproducible from logged config + seed.
